# Face-Mask-Detection
This project makes use of computer vision algorithms to detect mask on face and alert an administrator if someone is trying to enter the gates without wearing mask

To download the dataset you can use link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOVISyInvUOgXl3Fuyc0L3x-a17xENLU?usp=sharing

First run the file Face_mask_detection_colab_create_model.ipynb in google colab to generate the model nd then the face_mask_detection.ipynb
